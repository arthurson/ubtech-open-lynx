/**
 * Plays audio sent from the browser out through the robot's speaker, using a
 * standard AudioTrack on STREAM_MUSIC. This is the browser-mic -> robot-speaker half
 * of the walkie-talkie feature (the other half, robot-mic -> browser, is
 * AudioController).
 *
 * IMPORTANT / UNVERIFIED: whether the robot's physical speaker is actually reachable
 * through a plain AudioTrack, as opposed to being reserved for a dedicated TTS/audio
 * pipeline that bypasses the standard Android audio mixer, has NOT been confirmed by
 * static analysis - docs/hardware.md only documents a dedicated audio DSP node
 * (/dev/zl380tw) on the MIC array side for echo cancellation, and says nothing about
 * the speaker output path. playTestTone() exists specifically so this can be checked
 * on the physical unit before building anything on top of it.
 *
 * Same open-once, keep-open-for-the-session pattern as AudioController/
 * CameraController, using a dedicated HandlerThread so playback setup/teardown never
 * runs on whatever thread happens to call start()/shutdown() (e.g. an HTTP worker
 * thread).
