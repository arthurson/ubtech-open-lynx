/**
 * A minimal, dependency-free HTTP/1.1 server built directly on java.net.ServerSocket -
 * deliberately no NanoHTTPD or other library, to match the SDK's own "Android framework +
 * JDK only" dependency policy.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *  - Serves static files (the HTML/JS/CSS control panel) out of assets/web/.
 *  - Dispatches "/api/*" requests to a pluggable {@link ApiHandler} (implemented by
 *    MainActivity, which owns the Alpha2RobotApi instance).
 *  - Detects a WebSocket upgrade request on "/ws" and hands the raw socket off to
 *    {@link WebSocketServer} for the RFC 6455 handshake and framing.
 *  - Dispatches "/stream/*" requests to a pluggable {@link StreamHandler} that owns the
 *    raw socket for the connection's whole lifetime (used by the MJPEG camera feed,
 *    which is a single long-lived response, not a request/response pair).
 *
 * One thread-per-connection via a cached thread pool; traffic on this panel is
 * low-volume/interactive so this is simpler and more robust than NIO here. A streaming
 * connection just holds one pool thread for as long as the client stays connected -
 * fine at this panel's expected scale of a handful of browser tabs, not fine at
 * internet scale, which is out of scope for a LAN test tool.
